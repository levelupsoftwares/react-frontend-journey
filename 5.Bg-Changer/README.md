# Day 5 — Background Changer App 
On Day 5 of my React journey, I built a Background Changer App to explore state management and event handling in React.

## What I Learned
 - Using React’s useState hook to manage background color changes.

 - Handling button click events to trigger state updates.

 - Styling components dynamically based on state values.

 - Passing functions as props to child components for better code reusability.

## Features
- Change the background color with a single click.

- Multiple predefined color buttons.

- Real-time UI updates without reloading the page.
