#  Day 1 - React Setup + First Component

Welcome to **Day 1** of my React Front-End Journey!  
In this folder, Iâ€™ve:

##  What I Did

1. **Installed React Project** using:
   - `create-react-app`
   - `Vite` (for exploring faster dev experience)

2. **Created My First React Component**
   - Built a basic functional component using JSX.
   - Rendered the component to the DOM.
