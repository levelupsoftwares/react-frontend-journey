# React Front-End Learning Journey 

This repository documents my daily learning progress as I dive into React and Front-End Development.

##  Daily Logs

- Day 1: Setup React (CRA + Vite) and created a basic component using JSX
- Day 2: Recreated `React.createElement()` and worked with evaluated expressions
- Day 3: Learned `useState` and built a counter
- Day 4: Setup Tailwind CSS and practiced props (string, object, array)
- Day 5: Built a background color changer(mini project 1) using `useState`
