# Day 1 - Custom React Simulation (Without React!)

On the first day of my React learning journey, I decided to build a **super simple version of React** using just 
**HTML + JavaScript**. This helped me understand how React might work behind the scenes using the concepts of a virtual 
DOM and rendering logic.

##  What I Did

###  1. Setup HTML & Root Element
- Created a basic HTML file.
- Added a `<div>` with an `id="root"` to serve as the root DOM node.

###  2. Accessed it in JS using document.querySelector
###  3. Built a custom object that looked like an element (similar to Reactâ€™s virtual DOM).
###  4. Wrote a function to render this object into the root DOM element
